# Projection-Binary-Tree
A binary tree based application to simulate stock prices variations

An economist friend of mine asked me for a tree to show the growth or the decrease of a certain stock.
You can set:

- stock initial value
- number of periods to be examined
- the increase x period
- the decrease x period
- the probability to increase x period
- the probability to decrease x period

## The tool returns:
- all possible values with associated probability of happening, considering the combine cases.

#### Lauch parameters of the screen: 100, 0.1, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6, 3
